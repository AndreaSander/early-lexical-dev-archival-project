"2","- Functions for ANOVAs: aov_car(), aov_ez(), and aov_4()
- Methods for calculating p-values with mixed(): 'S', 'KR', 'LRT', and 'PB'
- 'afex_aov' and 'mixed' objects can be passed to emmeans() for follow-up tests
- NEWS: emmeans() for ANOVA models now uses model = 'multivariate' as default.
- Get and set global package options with: afex_options()
- Set orthogonal sum-to-zero contrasts globally: set_sum_contrasts()
- For example analyses see: browseVignettes(""afex"")
